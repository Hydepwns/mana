  Advanced GraphQL API for Mana-Ethereum with multi-datacenter and CRDT features.
  
  Provides a modern, flexible API for blockchain data with revolutionary capabilities:
  - Multi-datacenter queries: Query from optimal geographic location
  - CRDT operation tracking: Real-time conflict resolution visualization
  - Consensus-free subscriptions: Real-time updates without coordination overhead
  - Advanced filtering: Complex queries across distributed state
  - Performance introspection: Gas profiling and execution analysis
  - Cross-replica consistency: Eventually consistent data with conflict resolution
  
  ## Unique GraphQL Features
  
  Unlike traditional blockchain GraphQL APIs, this provides:
  - Distributed consensus introspection: Query CRDT operations and vector clocks
  - Geographic routing: Queries routed to nearest datacenter
  - Partition-tolerant queries: Continue operation during network splits
  - Conflict resolution history: See how distributed conflicts were resolved
  
  Note: Requires Absinthe dependency to be enabled.
