  @moduledoc """
  Behavior for block providers that can sync blockchain data.
  
  Block providers abstract the source of blockchain data, allowing
  Mana to sync from different sources like:
  - RPC endpoints (Infura, Alchemy, local nodes)
  - P2P networking (direct peer-to-peer sync)
  - Local files (for testing or offline sync)
  """
  
  @doc """
  Sets up the block provider and returns initial state.
  
  The setup process should:
  - Initialize connections (RPC clients, P2P peers, etc.)
  - Validate configuration
  - Return a state object that will be passed to other functions

  Gets the highest known block number from the provider.
  
  This is used to track sync progress and determine how many
  blocks need to be synced.

  Retrieves a specific block by number.

  and any other required data. The state may be updated
  to reflect connection changes, peer updates, etc.
