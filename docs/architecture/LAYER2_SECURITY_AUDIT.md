## Security Analysis

### 1. Cryptographic Security

**Proof Systems Evaluation:**

### 3. Bridge Security

**Cross-Chain Message Security:**
- Merkle proof validation for all cross-chain messages
- Withdrawal delays (7 days default for optimistic rollups)
- Challenge periods for disputed withdrawals
- Rate limiting to prevent spam attacks

**Asset Security:**
- Locked funds on L1 during L2 operations
- Proof-of-custody requirements
- Slashing conditions for malicious operators
- Insurance fund mechanisms

### 4. Network Security

**P2P Network Protection:**
